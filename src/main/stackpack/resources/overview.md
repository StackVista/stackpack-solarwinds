The [SolarWinds StackPack](https://l.stackstate.com/ui-solarwinds-stackpack-docs) allows near real time synchronization between SolarWinds Orion (SolarWinds) and StackState. When the integration is enabled, SolarWinds nodes, interfaces and connections will be added to the StackState topology as components and relations. Health status will be applied to the components in StackState.
